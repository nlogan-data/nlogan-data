I'm a data analyst with experience teaching high school math. 
As a teacher, I was best at helping students overcome misconceptions by leading them to the proper math practice, implementing a guide-on-the-side strategy. 
Teaching didn't present the pure analytical challenge that keeps me most motivated, though. 
I feel more energized while searching for data trends and using them to tell a story.


My skills include:

•	Data Cleaning

•	Combining Data

•	Descriptive, Diagnostic, and Predictive Analysis

•	Data Visualization

•	Storytelling with Data

•	Excel, PowerPoint, Tableau, SQL, pandas Python library


I'm meticulous, I enjoy solving problems and finding patterns, and I like working with others.
I intend to use data-centric stories to help a purpose-driven company find solutions and insights.
You can find my latest work on my [portfolio site](https://nlogandata.wordpress.com/projects/), or by browsing my GitHub repos.
I'm currently available for full-time work, and I'm open to remote, hybrid, or in-office work.
My personal interests include spending time with my wife and our dog, playing tennis or pickleball, listening to all kinds of music, and playing board or card games.
